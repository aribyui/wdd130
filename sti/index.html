                <h2>When was the last time you took your computer for technical repair?</h2>
                <p>
                    Perhaps at some point your computer began to present problems and the first thing you did 
                    was look for information in a youtube tutorial or research it on some Internet site.
                    All of this is valid. We live in times 
                    where information sources abound and these allow us to acquire knowledge to 
                    develop new skills, but you have to remember that among all this magnitude of 
                    information you will also find enthusiasts, fans, rumors, as well as untrained 
                    people who could deceive you.

                    Many times due to carelessness and downplaying the maintenance of our equipment, 
                    these deteriorate over time and their performance decreases, among other aspects.
