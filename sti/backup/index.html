                <h1>Is your computer getting slower and slower?</h1>
                <p>
                    Perhaps the first thing you do is look for information on a YouTube tutorial 
                    or research it on some Internet site. All of this is valid. We live in times 
                    where information sources abound and these allow us to acquire knowledge to 
                    develop new skills, but you have to remember that among all this magnitude of 
                    information you will also find enthusiasts, fans, rumors, as well as untrained 
                    people who could deceive you. Many times due to carelessness and downplaying 
                    the maintenance of our equipment, these deteriorate over time and their performance 
                    decreases, among other aspects.
