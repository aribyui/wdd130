      <p>
        How many times has your laptop or desktop computer become slow over time? 
        Perhaps the first thing you do is look for information on a YouTube tutorial 
        or research it on some Internet site. All of this is valid. We live in times 
        where information sources abound and these allow us to acquire knowledge to 
        develop new skills, but you have to remember that among all this magnitude of 
        information you will also find enthusiasts, fans, rumors, as well as untrained 
        people who could deceive you.
        As a Computer Science and Network Systems Technician, 
        and a current student at Brigham Young Idaho University, I am here to help you 
        and provide the solutions you need.

        inappropriate places, over time they will accumulate dust, adhere to the electronic 
        cards, and in the long run different problems will arise, be they intermittent, 
        performance and that the computer does not turn on. So that this does not start, 
        it is essential to maintain it every 6 months, we offer you a thorough and in-depth 
        service to extract dust and other residues inside the cabinet of your computer or 
        laptop.
