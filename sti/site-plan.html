        When was the last time you took your computer for technical repair?
        Perhaps at some point your computer began to present problems and the first thing 
        you did was look for information in a youtube tutorial or research it on some 
        Internet site. All of this is valid. We live in times where information sources 
        abound and these allow us to acquire knowledge to develop new skills, but you have 
        to remember that among all this magnitude of information you will also find enthusiasts, 
        fans, rumors, as well as untrained people who could deceive you.
