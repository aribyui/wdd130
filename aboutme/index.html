    <p>Hi! my name is Lizando, I'm 40 and I'm from Monterrey, México. I'm LDS member since I was a child and I glad to met the gospel.</p> 
    <p>Currently, I work as a computer and notebook technician. I like history, technician and programming books, I really enjoy to learn new things. My favorite book is "Pancho Villa: Una biografía narrativa" by Paco Ignacio II, "México Barbaro'" by John Kenneth Turner, but the most valuable for me is "The Book of Mormon".</p>
    <p>One of my favorite quotes is in DyC 88:118 "And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith".</p>
